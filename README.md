# Gobi-Enhancer
Adds library catalog links, highlighting, and quick notes for Gobi 3 
users in the Five Colleges


The Gobi Enhancer Script uses a browser plugin (Greasemonkey or 
Tampermonkey) to modify the library slips you see in Gobi, adding links, 
notes, and highlights to your screen. The goal is to streamline your 
workflow so that you can spend less time copying and pasting search 
terms into the library catalog.

To Install:

1: Add the plugin for your browser:

  Greasemonkey Plugin for Firefox - 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
  
  Tampermonkey Plugin for Chrome - 
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

2: Add the Gobi Enhancer Script to your browser by going to 
https://github.com/nnnicck/Gobi-Enhancer/blob/master/gobi_enhancer.user.js
and clicking on the "Raw" button, and downloading the file.


3: Go to Gobi and pull up a slip - you should see links and highlights.

Note that while you can get to gobi3.com without the WWW, this script expects you to be using www.gobi3.com, in order to work.
