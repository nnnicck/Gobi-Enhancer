# Gobi-Enhancer
Adds library catalog links, highlighting, and quick notes for Gobi 3 users in the Five Colleges


The Gobi Enhancer Script uses a browser plugin (Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey) to modify the library slips you see in Gobi, adding links, notes, and highlights to your screen. The goal is to streamline your workflow so that you can spend less time copying and pasting search terms into the library catalog.

To Install:

1: Add the plugin for your browser:

  Greasemonkey Plugin for Firefox - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
  
  Tampermonkey Plugin for Chrome - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

2: Open the Gobi Enhancer Script in your browser

3: Go to Gobi and pull up a slip - you should see links and highlights.
